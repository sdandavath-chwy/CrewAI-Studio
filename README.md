## Running with Docker Compose

To quickly set up and run CrewAI-Studio using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your system.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:sdandavath-chwy/CrewAI-Studio.git
cd CrewAI-Studio
```

2. Create a .env file for configuration.  Edit for your own configuration:
```
cp .env_example .env
```

docker-compose up --build
```

4. Access the application: http://localhost:8501

## Configuration

Before running the application, ensure you update the `.env` file with your API keys and other necessary configurations. An example `.env` file is provided for reference.

## Troubleshooting
1. In case of problems:
- Delete the `venv/miniconda` folder and reinstall `crewai-studio`.
- Rename `crewai.db` (it contains your crews but sometimes new versions can break compatibility).
- Raise an issue and I will help you.

2. Remove Stale or Broken Containers
```
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
```
Then retry:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
